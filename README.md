# SemAIDA: Semantic Technologies for the AIDA project

The [Artificial Intelligence for Data Analytics](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics-aida) (AIDA) project aims at applying new advances in AI and machine learning to address data wrangling issues, and help to automate the data analytics process. Semantic Web technologies have the potential of contributing in the Data Science pipeline by providing a more complete (semantic) understanding of the data. 


## Current projects

- Embedding the Semantics of Tabular Data (sources in this project).

- Tabular Data Semantics.  Auxiliary classes to access DBpedia, Wikidata and Google's KG for Web table matching. [(gihub-java)](https://github.com/ernestojimenezruiz/tabular-data-semantics) [(github-python)](https://github.com/ernestojimenezruiz/tabular-data-semantics-py)

- Data integration and Knowledge Graphs at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research: [https://github.com/NIVA-Knowledge-Graph/](https://github.com/NIVA-Knowledge-Graph/)

- **SemTab: Semantic Web Challenge on Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Matching**. This [challenge](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/challenges/sem-tab/) is collocated with the International Semantic Web Conference ([ISWC](https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/)) and the International Workshop on Ontology Matching ([OM](http://om2020.ontologymatching.org/)).
